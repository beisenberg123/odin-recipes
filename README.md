# odin-recipes
In this project I'm creating my first webpage.  I'll have a homepage with a short description, and then links to three other pages of recipes.  Each recipe page will include an image, description, steps, ingredients, and a link back to the main page.

In this project I'm demonstrating the following skills:
- Using the command line to navigate, create directories, create files, run commits, and push to GitHub
- Creating webpages using standard html language
- Adding titles and subheaders
- Creating paragraphs
- Linking to images
- Creating ordered and unordered lists
- Using bold and italicized text
- Using both absolute and relative links
